# ProxyDoS #Sheikh Nightshader #Version 1.0
 DDoS tool that uses scraped or custom proxies to perform flood. I recommend using your own proxies because the scraped proxies are usually unstable. Added both functions to suite needs. I am not responsible for the use and misuse of this tool. It is for Educational use only.

Usage:
python3 script.py --url http://example.com 

python3 proxydos.py -h more options
